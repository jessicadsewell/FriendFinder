# FriendFinder

In this assignment, I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

*JS, jQuery, Express and Path were used to retrieve and handle this data.*

The survey takes in 10 questions, with answeres scaling from 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question. The scores will then be compared to names within the array to find the most compatible friend.

Once there is a match, the new friend will display with a name and an image.
